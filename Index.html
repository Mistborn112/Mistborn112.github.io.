        <p class="location-text"> During my first ever trip to the UK my main goal was to visit as many unique bookstores and museums as possible and while I don't have an image of my favorite bookstore that I went to, this one is a close second. 
            This building is one of the many chain bookstores that London has but what sets it off from the others is the actual building itself. 
            I adore buildings that have such unique almost medieval architecture and so for this store to have not only that but also be a bookstore, I was in love immediately. 
            I could have spent hours in that store if not for my family wanting to move on. 
            I highly suggest visiting this bookstore if you are also a fan of such architecture and vibes. 
            The address is 82 Gower St, London WC1E 6EQ, United Kingdom.
