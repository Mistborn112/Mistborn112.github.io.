            </div>
            <p class="location-text"> During my first ever trip to the UK my main goal was to visit as many unique bookstores and museums as possible and while I don't have an image of my favorite bookstore that I went to, this one is a close second. 
                This building is one of the many chain bookstores that London has but what sets it off from the others is the actual building itself. 
                I adore buildings that have such unique almost medieval architecture and so for this store to have not only that but also be a bookstore, I was in love immediately. 
                I could have spent hours in that store if not for my family wanting to move on. 
                I highly suggest visiting this bookstore if you are also a fan of such architecture and vibes. 
                The address is 82 Gower St, London, United Kingdom.

            <h2>Hyde Park</h2> 
            <div class="image">
                <img src="./images/IMG_5207.jpeg" alt="Hyde Park London, UK">
            </div>
            <p class="location-text"> Another location that I adore is a very large park in London. 
                The park is called Hyde Park and it's right next to 3 different museums. 
                What i love about the park specifically at the time that i took this image is how beautiful the different coloured leaves on all the trees look because of autumn. 
                My favorite time of year is autumn so walking through a park crunching on the colourful leaves in not too cold but not too warm weather and watching the trees shift in the wind, was a lot of fun. 
                Next time I go to the UK I'll be sure to visit this park again as well as all the others I missed on my last trip.

            <h2>Greenwich Park at sunset</h2> 
            <div class="image">
                <img src="./images/IMG_5507.jpeg" alt="Greenwich Park, London, UK”  class="> 
            </div>
            <p class="location-text"> This is yet another park that I was so happy to visit. 
                Greenwich Park is a huge former hunting park in London. 
                The park has an observatory, a museum and is also where the prime meridian is located.
                When me and my family visited this park it was late in the day so the sun had already begun to set but despite this there was still a lot of people out and about.
                We didn't get to see the prime meridian because of how many people were there actually.
                I will say though that while the prime meridian fact is interesting you need to go on a bit of a hike to get to it as well as pay a fee to see it, 
                so it's not that crazy but still interesting.
